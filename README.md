This project is an online missing person tracker.

## Project Description
The project involves tracking people who are reported missing. The missing people details along with their photos are uploaded in the portal. The people are tracked using VGG16 based face similarity which compares the image uploaded by the user with the image taken by CCTV cameras. Cosine similiarity with a threshold of 70% was chosen for finding a positive face match and the exact co-ordinates of the detected person is reported to the nearest police station.
